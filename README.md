#### Resources
- [MODAL HELP](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_modals.asp): I wanted my modal in front of other elements on the page so I referenced this W3 Schools walkthrough.
- [HAMBURGER MENU](https://codepen.io/createlyn/pen/xJYmZx): This is the hamburger menu we made in class, but I added CSS grid to it, and changed the styling quite a bit.
- [CSS GRID](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Page_Inspector/How_to/Examine_grid_layouts)

##### Custom jQuery
- CONTACT FORM: The contact form has a submit button that is initially disables. When the user fills the "required" parts of the form out, the submit button becomes active. The form can also be reset by clicking the "reset" button.

- HAMBURGER MENU: jQuery listens for 'click' in order to toggle CSS animation, which is making the menu appear.

##### Custom javaScript
- MODAL: Used javaScript to call open the modal click, and then listen for click again to close.
